# ðŸš€ GPU-Hack: Decentralized GPU Sharing for AI Compute

**HackETHon Kyiv 2025 Submission**

GPU-Hack is a prototype for a decentralized platform that allows users to share their GPU resources for distributed AI workloads and earn rewards based on real-time hardware metrics. It turns idle personal hardware into a earning tool, bridging compute supply with blockchain-based demand.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Features

- ðŸ“¡ **Live GPU Telemetry**  
  Stream GPU metrics such as power draw, temperature, memory usage, and session time.

- ðŸ’» **Session Tracking**  
  Monitor and log each GPU-sharing session per user.

- ðŸ“ˆ **Metric-Based Rewards (Prototype)**  
  Design to support incentives based on transparent GPU usage metrics.

## ðŸŸ¡ Yellow Network Integration

This project was developed as part of the **Yellow Challenge @ ETH Kyiv 2025**, with integration of **NitroLite**, Yellowâ€™s clearnode.

## ðŸ§  CleanNode Observability

While not custom-built, the **Yellow CleanNode** and **NitroLite** clients helped us simulate a trusted telemetry stream. Our telemetry collects:

- Session Start/Stop
- Power Draw

## ðŸ’¡ Vision

- Transform personal GPUs into income-generating assets.
- Provide decentralized AI compute resources for future dApps.
- Enable secure, on-chain validation of hardware usage using ClearNode.
